1. This report aims to conduct a sentiment analysis using an attention-based recurrent neural network to evaluate the consistency of reviews with corresponding ratings retrieved from Amazon.com.
2. The data was obtained from Kaggle, an online community allowing users to access and publish datasets. The original complete dataset is called Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis, published by Adam Bittlingmayer and last updated in Nov. 2019. Two txt. files comprise the whole dataset, one of which is for training and with 3.6 million Amazon reviews; the other of which is for testing and with 0.4 million Amazon reviews.
3. This report shows that a not so complex model, such as a bidirectional LSTM model, can be improved by a larger training dataset and a well pre-trained feature embeddings. Additionally, the performance of a bidirectional LSTM model and an attention-based LSTM model may be similarly effective when doing a sentiment analysis. However, the latter model may be more appropriate because of its slightly higher accuracy and higher efficiency in decreasing the loss. An attention-based LSTM model is thus recommended to conduct a sentiment analysis on reviews of binary classification.
